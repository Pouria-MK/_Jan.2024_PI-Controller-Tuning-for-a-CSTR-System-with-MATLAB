# PID Controller Tuning for a CSTR System with MATLAB

This project focuses on the tuning of a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller for a Continuous Stirred-Tank Reactor (CSTR) system using MATLAB. The CSTR, a common chemical reactor model, presents significant control challenges due to its inherent nonlinear dynamics and time-varying behavior. In this project, the PID controller is designed and tuned to maintain the reactor temperature that contains a series reaction under dynamic operating conditions. 

MATLAB is employed to simulate the CSTR model and implement various PID tuning methods such as Ziegler-Nichols, Cohen-Coon and Broida. The project provides insight into the controller's performance, comparing stability, response time, and robustness across different tuning methods. The repository contains MATLAB code, step-by-step explanations, and visualizations of the system's dynamic behavior and controller performance.
